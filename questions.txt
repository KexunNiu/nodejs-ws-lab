Q1. I saw Node.js WebSockets Lab header, and a black window there is a yello anime rabbit in it,
when I put my cursor on and drag it, it turns red and move with my cursor. 
In the terminal, it always updates the 2D coordinates with me. Eg: RECV: {"x":100,"y":101}

Q2. TypeScript is OOP programming language, but Javascript is web programming language.
TypeScript can be used anywhere including browser, device or OS, but Javascript can only be used on web browser.
TypeScript supports interfaces but JavaScript does not.

Q3. The bundlers makes sure that the import path is correct implemented.
So that the development workflow doesn't have to change. And the bundlers can reduce the processing time,
because they are packed up.
